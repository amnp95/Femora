## Installation

Femora is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip.

```bash
pip install femora
```

## First Mesh

Create your first simple mesh in less than 10 lines of code.

```python
import femora as fm

# Initialize the MeshMaker
mm = fm.MeshMaker()

# Define a material
concrete = mm.material.add_concrete(name="Conc30", fc=-30, ec=25000)

# Create a section
rect_sec = mm.section.add_rect(width=0.4, height=0.4, material=concrete)

# Generate Mesh
grid = mm.mesh.create_grid(x=[0, 3, 6], y=[0, 4, 8], section=rect_sec)

print(f"Generated {len(grid.nodes)} nodes and {len(grid.elements)} elements.")
```
